# build-detectron2

Pre-built Linux wheels for
[Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), across Python,
PyTorch, CUDA, and CPU architectures.

## Installation

Following the PyTorch convention, artifacts are published to a separate index
for each CUDA version. Each wheel has a local version suffix that identifies the
CUDA version, PyTorch version, and C++ ABI it was built against, such as
`detectron2==0.6+cu12.8torch2.10.0cxx11abiTRUE`, and requires the matching
PyTorch release.

Pre-built wheels are available on
[Astral's GPU indexes](https://wheels.astral.sh/index.html).
For example, to install a CUDA 12.8 build:

```console
$ uv add detectron2 --index astral-cu128=https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/
```

This configures the index and uses it as the source for `detectron2`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
detectron2 = { index = "astral-cu128" }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "astral-cu128"
url = "https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/"
```

Or, with `uv pip`:

```console
$ uv pip install --index https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/ detectron2
```

## Supported versions
